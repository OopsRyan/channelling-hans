1.	You can choose some countries in the checkbox to see their changes. You can also see their traces and lines if you check "Show traces" and "Show lines" boxes.

2.	You can fade out countries by moving the mouse over a certain area in the map, 
	but it will not work when you have chosen some countries in the checkbox.

3.	You can move the mouse over a particular circle you have interest in, 
	and then focus lines will be drawn so that you can see its detailed data.
